# Practicing-Stuff
In this Repository i normally practice code that i want to eventually use. Some of the contents come directly from my Obsidian Vault

(Note: The main reason of this vault is for job Applications)

## This Vault has Different categories of tasks and proyects that i have done in my self taught journey across the years

* [UC] University Stuff / Courses Stuff (Things that i got from a learning place or any page that im learning from)
* [Self] Self taught code (or any code that comes from me without any other guide, mainly giving solutions to pre-made problems)
* [Show] Things that i do to Show-off my code capabilities
